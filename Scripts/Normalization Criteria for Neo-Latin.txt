Normalization Criteria for Neo-Latin Texts

These are suggested criteria for the normalization (not modernization!) of Neo-Latin texts to facilitate their collation and comparison.

The processes described in this document include the regularization of vowels and consonants according to modern norms for editing Latin
(j > i, v > u), as well as the deletion of diacritic accents used in Neo-Latin—such as the circumflex, which differentiates the ablative
from the nominative/accusative (eâdem/eadem, quâ/qua), and adjectives/adverbs from pronouns (illô/illo, nullô/nullo, quî/qui). Grave accents,
which are used to mark the prepositions a (ad) and e (ex) to avoid assimilation (à medulla, è sole), as well as to mark adverbs (blandè,
facilè, imò, modestissimè, porrò), are also to be removed.

Basic Graphic Normalization (Some of these replacements should be performed multiple times, as the base text will change after each iteration.)

# original value > # replaced value
Delete all <, >, {RUB.}, {LAT.}, {HD.}, {AD.}, {CW.}, {GL.}, {CB1.}, {CB2.}, {IN.} [+], (^), [^], (), [], or any other encoding marks. Replace them
with the appropriate convention (e.g., use colors, apply strikethrough for deletions or delete the text, etc.)

Deletion of Spaces

^p+space > space
- + space > nothing
