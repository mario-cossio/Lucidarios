Normalization Criteria for Neo-Latin Texts

These are suggested criteria for the normalization (not modernization!) of Neo-Latin texts to facilitate their collation and comparison.

The processes described in this document include the regularization of vowels and consonants according to modern norms for editing classical
Latin (j > i, v > u), as well as the deletion of diacritic accents used in Neo-Latin—such as the circumflex, which differentiates the ablative
from the nominative/accusative (eâdem/eadem, quâ/qua), and adjectives/adverbs from pronouns (illô/illo, nullô/nullo, quî/qui). Grave accents, which
are used to mark the prepositions a (ad) and e (ex) to avoid assimilation (à medulla, è sole), as well as to mark adverbs (blandè, facilè, imò, modestissimè,
porrò), are also to be removed.

Basic Graphic Normalization (Some of these replacements should be performed multiple times, as the base text will change after each iteration.)

Delete all <, >, {RUB.}, {LAT.}, {HD.}, {AD.}, {CW.}, {GL.}, {CB1.}, {CB2.}, {IN.} [+], (^), [^], (), [], or any other encoding marks. Replace them with
the appropriate convention (e.g., use colors, apply strikethrough for deletions, or delete the text outright, etc.)
