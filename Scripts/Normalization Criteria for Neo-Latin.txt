Normalization Criteria for Neo-Latin Texts

These are suggested criteria for the normalization (not modernization!) of Neo-Latin texts, to facilitate their collation and comparison.

The processes described in this document include the regularization of vowels and consonants according to modern norms for editing classical
Latin (j > i, but u > v), as well as the removal of diacritic accents commonly used in Neo-Latin—-such as the circumflex, which distinguishes the ablative
from the nominative/accusative (eâdem/eadem, quâ/qua), or adjectives/adverbs from pronouns (illô/illo, nullô/nullo, quî/qui).

Grave accents, which were used to mark the prepositions à (for ad) and è (for ex) to avoid assimilation (à medulla, è sole), as well as to mark adverbs
(blandè, facilè, imò, modestissimè, porrò), are also to be removed.

Basic Graphic Normalization
(Note: Some of these replacements should be performed iteratively, as the base text will change after each pass.)

Delete all of the following encoding marks: <, >, {RUB.}, {LAT.}, {HD.}, {AD.}, {CW.}, {GL.}, {CB1.}, {CB2.}, {IN.} [+], (^), [^], (), [], or any other markup.
Replace them with the appropriate editorial conventions (e.g., use color, apply strikethrough for deletions, or simply delete the text outright, etc.)

oe > e (foemina, foetus > femina, fetus)
p  > pp (suplicium > supplicium)
t > tt (quatuor > quattuor)
u > v (only when u functions as a consonant: ueritate > veritate, but conspicuus  > conspicuus)
y > i (except in Greek loanwords)
